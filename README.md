# ------ Hangman: Dismemberer ------

  * * *

  A thrilling and fully featured CLI-based game played as the victim, a captive desperately
  trying to guess the hidden word before the perpetrator dismembers them.

  **Instructions:**

  * You start with 10 HP, which is directly tied to the number of limbs and accessories you have.
  
  * Each time you guess a letter incorrectly, the perpetrator will dismember a body part or take an accessory from you, reducing your HP.
  
  * If you guess a letter correctly, the perpetrator gains 1 IP (insanity point).
  
  * If you manage to guess three consecutive letters correctly, the perpetrator's IP will reach a critical point,
    and you'll be presented with the opportunity to attempt escape.
    
  * If you decide to take the opportunity, you'll be asked to guess one more letter.
    If you get this letter right, you'll be able to escape the perpetrator, reveal the hidden word, and beat the game!
    But if you guess incorrectly, you'll take critical damage, reducing your HP even further.

  **Survive long enough to guess the hidden word and escape the perpetrator**
